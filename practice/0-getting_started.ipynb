    "This file - a Jupyter notebook -  does not follow the standard pattern with Python code in a text file. Instead, a Jupyter notebook is stored as a file in the [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. The advantage is that we can mix formatted text, Python code and code output. It requires the Jupyter notebook server to run it though, and therefore isn't a stand-alone Python program as described above. Other than that, there is no difference between the Python code that goes into a program file or a Jupyter notebook.\n",

Beyond particular language supports VS Code also has solutions for things like version control, container management or cloud access. VS Code works equally well on Windows, MAC or Linux. \n",
